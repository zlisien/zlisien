Summary
---

I'm a NH based Technical Recruiter focused on Software, Data, and Product (UI/UX) oriented roles. I currently work with Edge Staffing and the two main reasons I joined this startup of a team is these are actually areas of interest to me, and there is a strong focus on building good relationships (with both clients and candidates).  

If you're in these areas and looking for opportunities, definitely reach out and connect! Especially if you're in New England or the East Coast.
